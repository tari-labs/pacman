### Reverse-Engineers

Thanks to **Jamey Pittman** for compiling [The Pac-Man Dossier](http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html) from his own research and those of other reverse-engineers, notably 'Dav' and 'JamieVegas' from [this Atari Age forum thread](http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/68707-pac-man-ghost-ai-question/).  Further thanks to Jamey Pittman for replying to my arcade implementation-specific questions with some very elaborate details to meet the accuracy requirements of this project.

Thanks to **Bart Grantham** for sharing his expert knowledge on Ms. Pac-Man's internals, providing me with an annotated disassembly and notes on how fruit paths work in meticulous detail.
